# FineTune_GPT3.5Turbo_StockForecasting

This project investigates the performance of fine-tuning OpenAIâ€™s GPT-3.5 Turbo for stock price forecasting. Experiments on the Bigdata22 and CIKM18 datasets demonstrate that fine-tuning can improve both accuracy and F1-score. However, the results still fall short compared to traditional models, highlighting the importance of further domain-specific optimization in financial NLP.
